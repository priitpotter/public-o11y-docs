    <embed>
      <h3>Private connectivity<a name="sd-private-connectivity" class="headerlink" href="#sd-private-connectivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
    </embed>

If you prefer not to send data to Splunk public endpoints using HTTPS, you can use AWS Private Link to ingest data from sources deployed on AWS. See :ref:`aws-privatelink` for more information.

.. raw:: html
  
    <embed>
      <h3>Data retention<a name="sd-data-retention" class="headerlink" href="#sd-data-retention" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
    </embed>

When you send data to Splunk Observability Cloud, it is ingested and stored for a period of time that varies depending on the product and type of contract. See :ref:`data-o11y` for more information.

You can monitor subscription usage for each product depending on the type of subscription. See :ref:`subscription-overview` for more information.

.. raw:: html
  
    <embed>
      <h2>Subscription types, expansions, renewals, and terminations<a name="sd-subscriptions" class="headerlink" href="#sd-subscriptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
    </embed>

Your subscription to Splunk Observability Cloud depends on the Splunk product: host-based or usage-based for Splunk IM and Splunk APM, or web sessions for Splunk RUM or synthetics check for Splunk Synthetic Monitoring.

.. raw:: html
  
    <embed>
      <h3>Host-based subscriptions<a name="sd-host-subscriptions" class="headerlink" href="#sd-host-subscriptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
    </embed>

Host-based subscriptions base billing on the total number of unique hosts reporting data to Splunk Observability Cloud on an hourly basis, then calculate the average of those hourly measurements across each billing month. The calculation is done for each host, container, custom metric, and high resolution metric. A host is a physical, non-virtualized environment, or a virtual instance in a virtualized or public cloud environment, that reports metric data to Splunk Observability Cloud. You can increase the amount of hosts or containers per host if needed.

.. raw:: html
  
    <embed>
      <h3>Usage-based subscriptions<a name="sd-usage-subscriptions" class="headerlink" href="#sd-usage-subscriptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
    </embed>

Usage-based pricing is suited for custom metrics, containerized environments, and monitoring serverless environments or cloud services that don't provide a view of underlying hosts. Usage is calculated depending on the product or feature. For example, Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring usage-based pricing relies on metric time series (MTS), whereas Splunk Real User Monitoring calculates usage from the number of web sessions. For more information on subscription usage and monitoring in Splunk Observability Cloud, see :ref:`subscription-overview`.

    <embed>
      <h3>Overages<a name="sd-overages" class="headerlink" href="#sd-overages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
    </embed>

Splunk Observability Cloud overages are based on usage measured over a month. Overages are incurred if the monthly usage is higher than your paid subscription. Splunk Observability Cloud provides transparent usage data with granular daily detailed reports on all monitored hosts, containers, and metrics. You can also turn on alerts or setup tokens to manage your usage. See :ref:`subscription-overview` for more information.

    <embed>
      <h3>Subscription updates, renewals, and terminations<a name="sd-subscription" class="headerlink" href="#sd-subscription" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
    </embed>

- Increase host-based or usage-based capacity.
- Add products and features to your subscription.
- Upgrade to enterprise edition licensing with Service Bureau features.

Splunk Observability Cloud informs about the need for renewal through a banner that appears 15 days prior to the subscription expiration date. For more information on subscription renewals, contact your Splunk sales representative.

On expiration date, a 15-day grace period starts. During the grace period, users see a banner when logging in reminding them of the expiration. After the grace period, the subscription enters suspended mode, which lasts 30 days and during which users can't log in. After the 30 day suspension, the account is terminated and the data stored on the account is deleted.
